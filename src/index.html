            <div class="card-text">
                <p>The story of Gideon and his 300 men in Judges 7 is a powerful reminder that victory doesn’t come from
                    overwhelming numbers or human strength, but from faith, trust, and obedience to God. In a world that
                    often measures success by resources, status, or might, Gideon's story speaks to the courage of
                    trusting in a purpose greater than ourselves, even when the odds seem impossible.</p>

                <p>Today, we may feel outnumbered by challenges—whether it's personal struggles, societal pressures, or
                    battles we face in our faith. But Gideon's story teaches us that it’s not about how big the
                    challenge is; it’s about how big our faith is. With God on our side, even the smallest team, the
                    quietest voice, or the humblest person can make a profound difference.</p>

                <p>Let this be a reminder that sometimes, God intentionally uses our weaknesses to showcase His
                    strength. So, don’t be discouraged by the size of your “army.” Instead, like Gideon, move forward
                    with confidence, knowing that God can turn your small beginnings into a victory that defies all
                    expectations. What matters isn’t how many you have by your side—it’s who is guiding you. Let that
                    truth inspire you to face each day boldly!</p>
